            <p id="po">The origin of the word "travel" is most likely lost to <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History" target="_blank">history</a>. The term "travel" may
                originate from the Old French word travail, which means 'work'.[2] According to the Merriam-Webster
                dictionary, the first known use of the word travel was in the <strong> <abbr title="Important">14th
                        century</abbr></strong> . It also states that the word comes from Middle English travailen,
                travelen (which means to torment, labor, strive, journey) and earlier from Old French travailler (which
                means to work strenuously, toil).

                In English, people still occasionally use the words travail, which means struggle. According to Simon
                Winchester in his book The Best Travelers' Tales (2004), the words travel and travail both share an even
                more ancient root: a Roman instrument of torture called the tripalium (in Latin it means "three stakes",
                as in to impale).[citation needed] This link may reflect the extreme difficulty of travel in ancient
                times. Travel in modern times may or may not be much easier, depending upon the destination. Travel to
                Mount Everest, the Amazon rainforest, extreme tourism, and adventure travel are more difficult forms of
                travel. Travel can also be more difficult depending on the method of travel, such as by bus, cruise
                ship, or even by bullock cart.[3]</p>

            <p id="pll">We’re all guilty of routine. It’s a natural part of life. But with routine comes complacency and
                a tad bit of laziness. That’s not necessarily bad, but you’re often unmotivated to break free when you
                become stuck in a routine.

                Travel challenges your everyday comfort and encourages personal growth.

                It’s a universal truth that if you’re not undertaking <span> new experiences</span> or encountering new
                stimuli, you’re not growing. Let’s face it. No one ever got anywhere by standing still—unless you happen
                to be a teleporting superhuman.

                Travel plays an integral role in forcing you outside of your comfort zone, encouraging you to become a
                stronger, better version of yourself. It’s only through the experience of new cultures, new situations,
                and even new problems that people can grow as, well, people.</p>
